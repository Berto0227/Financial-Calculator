#Task 12
#Bond and Investment calculator
#Programmer: Berto Swanepoel
#This program will help anyone to calculate investment as well as calculate you monthly installment when wanting to buy a house.

#This part is where you ask the user to make decision, I have also explained to the user what the meaning of both words are.
print("Choose either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu below to proceed: ")

#The user's decision in stored in a variable call choice as this is he's or her's choice. It does not matter how the user enters the word as
#it will automatically be changed to lowercase.

#If the user's decision is invest the ask the following information.
#How much do they want to use as a starting deposit.
#What is the investment rate that the bank is offering them. This must be entered without the decimal.
#Then the user must enter the amount of year's they wish do have this investment.
#Once we have that information we need to know how the investment will be structured, nl: simple or compound.
#Lastly the investment rate is devided by 100 to get the decimal value needed for calculations.

#If the user has chosen the bond option, we will be needing some information so we will have to ask the user.
#We will need to know what is the value of the house, or what is the loan amount.
#What is the interest rate that the user is getting from the bank per year.
#How many months will the user be needing to pay of the house bond.
#Interest rate is now devided by 12 to get a monthly interest rate value.
#Once all that information has been given the calculation can be made.
#Now we print our the result along with a little sentance stating the monthly installment based on user's information.
